# Full-Stack-Web-Developer-Stream-0
At its core our Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp is based on HTML & CSS, JavaScript and Python. 
We use this combination of languages to bring you practical, real-world, modules and labs that you will use to create professional grade projects that you can proudly show to the world via Git and GitHub.
We want you to flourish on the programme, to bring out your natural skills and instincts for rational and creative thinking. 
To do this we want you to have the fundamentals of these languages and techologies in place before moving on to the Streams that follow.

To help you get there we have put together a comprehensive collection of carefully chosen resources that cover all the requirements to begin the main programme. You'll use a combination of free web based videos and tutorials and download apps so you can study directly your phone or tablet. You'll gain badges when completing study sections and unlocking learning content. We want you to send on you badges to us so we see how you are getting on before starting the main programme.
