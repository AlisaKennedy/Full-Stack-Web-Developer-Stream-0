<p>At its core our Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp is based on HTML &amp; CSS, JavaScript and Python. 
We use this combination of languages to bring you practical, real-world, modules and labs that you will use to create professional grade projects and proudly show to the world via Git and GitHub.
We want you to flourish on the programme, to bring out your natural skills and instincts for rational and creative thinking. 
To do this we want you to have the fundamentals of these languages and technologies in place before moving on to the Streams that follow.</p>

<p>To help you get there we have put together a comprehensive collection of carefully chosen resources that cover all the requirements to begin the main programme. You'll use a combination of free web based videos and tutorials and download apps so you can study directly your phone or tablet. You'll gain badges when completing study sections and unlocking learning content. We want you to send on your badges to us so we see how you are getting on before starting the main programme.</p>

<p>And before immersing yourself in JavaScript and Python, you'll get to grips with core coding concepts common to nearly all languages before setting about understanding the syntax of these languages. You'll do this by using Scratch, the number one tool used to teach coding beginners in Coder Dojo's around the globe.</p>

<p>We also want you to build up a portfolio of your work right from the start of the main programme. You'll show your code right here on GitHub - the worlds most popular social coding network. To do that we have an excellent set of lessons to get you up and running with Git and GitHub</p>

<p>So be curious, get stuck in, and enjoy!</p>
